  <h2>Markham residents are against the proposed "Alternate 1B"(overpass connecting to Markland Street) for the following reasons:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Road safety</li>
    <li>Additional traffic onto an already busy street</li>
    <li>Traffic infiltration</li>
    <li>Noise</li>
    <li>Air quality</li>
    <li>There are better alternatives</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Video: Markland street during morning rush hour</h2>
  <p>The video below is just 1 sample of how the morning rush hour looks like on Markland St.</p>
  <p>0:55 A silver car decided not to wait and drove on a lane not supposed to be driven on.</p>
  <p>A few others, in hope to beat the traffic, made a left turn onto Laneway-6 which is literally
    the backyard garage of many residents.  Laneway-6 is narrow which makes it very challenging and
    dangerous for residents to back-out of their garages<p>

  <p>1:23 (1 Silver and 1 Black car)</p>

  <h2>Traffic infiltration: Woodbine Ave. -> Markland St. -> Laneway 6</h2>
  <p>More often than not, frustrated drivers stuck on Woodbine Ave. or Markland St. would infiltrate into Laneway-6
    and use it as a shortcut/bypass to beat the traffic.  Laneway-6 is literally the backyard garage of many residents.
    It is narrow, and with the infiltrated traffic (often travelling at high speed), makes it very challenging and dangerous for
    residents to back-out of their garages<p>

  <h2>Markland Street: Daily Commute Challenge</h2>
  <p>Ask any local residents and they can tell you the challenges we face on Markland St. during rush hour</p>
  <p>As you can see in the screenshot below, Markland Street is our only way out onto Major MacKenzie Drive.</p>
  <p>All local traffic gets funneled onto Markland Street as a single lane, waiting for access to Major MacKenzie Drive</p>
  <p>Moulton Gate is one of the route for local residents to left turn onto Markland St.</p>
  <p>Markland St. has a slight curve near Moulton Gate, which makes left turn more difficult because we cannot
    see on-coming traffic beyond the curve. On top of that, the intersection between Moulton Gate and
    Markland St is also a school bus drop off zone.</p>
  <p>Adding more traffic, especially out of region drivers who are not familiar with the daily dynamics of the road, is
    very dangerous for drivers and pedestrians</p>
  <p>Markland Street is already very busy as-is.  It is unwise to add more traffic to it.</p>

  <h2>Suggestions</h2>
  <p>Local residents think this overpass should be constructed further north in order to fulfill its purpose
    of diverting traffic to Richmond Hill (i.e. freeing up Woodbine Ave. and Major Mackenzie Dr.)</p>
  <p>As you can see in the above video, there is a continuous stream of traffic coming from the north on Woodbine Ave.</p>
  <p>Most of them will make a right turn onto Major Mackenzie Drive to either go onto Highway 404 or continue westbound to Richmond Hill</p>
  <p>If the region wants to alleviate traffic on Woodbine Ave and Major Mackenzie Dr.,
    it stands to reason to construct the overpass further away from Major Mackenzie Dr. in order to
    divert traffic away sooner.</p>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>
  <p>We would like the region's project team to re-consider the alternative, but this time assign more
    weight to the concerns raised by local residents who will have to live with this decision for years to come</p>
